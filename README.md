This is a step by step beginner guide to **shell scripting** in LINUX (bash)

The content has been taken from [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) but implemented by me.

I would suggest you to clone this repo to your system (UNIX-like) so that you can easily implement and experiment with the scripts in your favourite terminal. This would also help since there are some scripts that rely on other scripts.
**if some script on execution says *permission denied* make sure that you have allowed the script to run as executable.**
